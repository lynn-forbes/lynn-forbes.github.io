   Lynn kept her sense of humour, even when work was challenging.

After a job in international marketing, and a position with `Foremost Mobile
Equipment <http://foremost.ca/>`_, Lynn started her career as a real-estate
agent.  She worked for a while in commercial, but settled in the residential
market "south of the river", starting with Doherty Brothers, then moving to
P.J. Toole & Cote, Toole Peet, and finishing with Remax.  Widely known as an
expert in the city center, Lynn helped many people negotiate the real-estate
market.  She particularly relished helping young couples get established,
buying their first homes, and starting a life.  Many of her clients became
life-long friends.
